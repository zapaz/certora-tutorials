 * On the right side of the implication above we see a f.selector.
 * The use of f.selector is very similar to its use in solidity -
 * since f is a parametric method that calls every function in contract in parallel,
 * we specify (or selecting) to address one particular path - when the f.selector was scheduleMeeting.
